                               PS3MFW tasks v0.2.11 OtherOS++
==============================================================

Several exciting new tasks have been created. The most interesting one is a new privacy patch, which keeps PS3 from sending personally identifiable information to many configurable domain names: After jailbreak became available for PS3, reverse engineers discovered that the PS3 collects a multitude of personal information without your knowledge, such as such as your TV model, a list of all usb devices (including product IDs) you ever plugged into your PS3, usage statistics, which games and media you play and more.

The Digital Millenium Copyright Act (DMCA) specifically allows for consumers to circumvent technological protection measures in order to protect their privacy. Even though there was little doubt concerning the legality of PS3MFW Builder before because it in itself does not circumvent any technological protection measures, this new feature makes using it inside the USA fully DMCA compliant.

Additionally, several new customizations including a firmware version spoofer, a way to edit the look and sound of the boot sequence by inserting your own coldboot files, and a task to replace the default "Airbush" XMB theme. Now it can also create modified firmwares that can be installed on PS3s with broken Blu-Ray drives as well as create firmwares that can convert demo (kiosk/shop) units into regular retail PS3s! A bug that prevented USB storage devices from being shown under Game Data Utility was fixed.

The new tasks can be found at www.git-hacks.com/ps3mfw

-------------------------------
Unofficial 0.2.11 update 'euss'
-------------------------------

- Updated Spoof task up to including 4.11
- Expanded firmware list up to including 4.11
- New task made on request:
  - broken_bluetooth.tcl - Allows you to remove Bluetooth firmware installation so that the MFW can be installed without a working Bluetooth board (circumventing errorcode 0x8002F1F9). This is potentially dangerous if used on a PS3 with a working BT/Wifi board, and should only be used if the BT/Wifi is broken.

Translation Guide:
* The file is in XML UTF-8 format. Make sure you use an UTF-8 compatible editor (e.g. Notepad++)
* Name the file itself in normal characters only (format is "English name_localised name, e.g. French_Francais.xml and /not/ French_Français.xml !). 
* Provide a localised translation for each word/line within the XML subitems.
* Save and try it in PS3MFW Builder. In some cases (e.g. Korean) the characters do not appear in the editor, but /will/ apear inside MFW Builder because of the UTF-8 encoder.
